##Tasks

###3.TASKS

####3.1 The Task Parallel Library (TPL)

The Task Parallel Library (TPL) has been introduced in the version 4.0 of the CLR

The Task Parallel Library (TPL) is based on the concept of a task, which represents an asynchronous operation. In some ways, a task resembles a thread or ThreadPool work item, but at a higher level of abstraction. The term task parallelism refers to one or more independent tasks running concurrently.

####3.2 Differences between Thread and Task

The differences are:
- A task could return a value, not a thread (actually, There is no direct mechanism to return the result from thread.)
- We can chain tasks together to execute one after the other. (with conditional continuation)
- Establish a parent/child relationship when one task is started from another task
- Child task exception can propagate to parent task
- Task support cancellation through the use of cancellation tokens.
- Asynchronous implementation is easy in task, using’ async’ and ‘await’ keywords.


####3.3 Task

```cs
Task(Action action); //A unit work
Task<TResult>(Func func); //A unit work with a result
TaskFactory
TaskFactory<TResult>
TaskScheduler
TaskCompletionSource //For manually controlling task's workflow
```

#####3.3.1 Task starting

```cs
static void Main()
{
	Task.Run(() => Console.WriteLine("I'm the task");
}
```

#####3.3.2 Returning values

Task<TResult> could be seen as a _future_ (or _promise_ ...). 

```cs
static void Main()
{
	Task<int> primeNumberQuantity = Task.Run(() =>
		Enumerable.Rabge(2, 3000000).Count(n =>
			Enumerable.Range(2, (int)Math.Sqrt(n)-1).All(i => n % i > 0)));
	
	Console.WriteLine("The compuation running...");
	Console.WriteLine("The quantity is : " + primeNumerQuantity);
}
```
The second line will be displayed in the console when the task has returned a value. As you can see, the Task<TResult> is like a future.

#####3.3.3 State object / AsyncState object

######3.3.3.1 State object

It's better to use TaskFactory than Task.Run because there are more options.
Task.Run is a shortcut.

```cs
static void Main()
{
	var task = Task.Factory.StartNew(DisplayMessage,"Hello World!");
	task.Wait();
}

static void DisplayMessage(object state)
{
	Console.WriteLine(state);
}
```



######3.3.3.2 AsyncState object

```cs
static void Main()
{
	var task = Task.Factory.StartNew(DisplayMessage,"Hello World!");
	task.Wait();
}

static void DisplayMessage(object state)
{
	Console.WriteLine(state);
}
```

#####3.3.4 TaskCreationOptions

- LongRunning : the scheduler will dedicate a thread to avoid the switch context for the long running task
- PreferFairness : the sheduler will try to ensure that taks are scheduled in the order they were started
- AttachedToParent : dedictated to the child task



####3.4 Exceptions

#####3.4.1 Exceptions

Unlike the threads, the tasks propagate the exception.

#####3.4.2 Unobserved exceptions


####3.4 Chaining taks (Continuation)

#####3.4.1 ContinueWith

To chain the tasks, we will use __ContinueWith__

```cs
Task task1 = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => Console.Write("1st task"));
Task task2 = task1.ContinuationWith(antRef => Console.Write("2nd Task. The ref of the previous tasks : " + antRef));
```

By default, the two tasks may execute on different tasks. To avoid that, you must specify __TaskContinuationOptions.ExecuteSynchronously__.

```cs
Task task1 = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => Console.Write("1st task"));
Task task2 = task1.ContinuationWith(antRef => Console.Write("2nd Task. The ref of the previous tasks : " + antRef)
, TaskContinuationOptions.ExecuteSynchronously);
```

#####3.4.2 Example

```cs
Task.Factory.StartNew<int>(() => 16)
	.ContinueWith(ant => ant.Result * 4)
	.ContinueWith(ant => ant.Math.Sqrt(ant.Result))
	.ContinueWith(ant => Console.WriteLine(ant.Result)); //8
```
#####3.4.3 Continuation and exception



#####3.4.4 Conditional conditions



####3.5 Task cancellation


####3.6 Task scheduler

The task scheduler allocates tasks to threads and it is represented by the abstract TaskScheduler class.
There are two concrete implementation:
- _default scheduler_
- _synchronization context scheduler_

####3.7 AggregateException & Flatten/Handle
