####6.1 Singleton

#####6.1.1 Singleton vs static

- singleton can extend a base class
- singleton can implement an interface
- singleton can be initialized lazily or asynchronously while a static class is generally initialized when it is first loaded
- singleton is OO pattern (inhertitance, polymorphisme)
- singleton can be treated as a normal object

But it is impossible to test the singleton.

#####6.1.2 Singleton and MemoryBarrier


#####6.2 Static member

If two threads want to call the property DateTime.Now, an error will be raised. Only way to avoid it's to lock the type itself:

```cs
lock(typeof(DateTime))
{
	return DateTime.Now;
}
```
